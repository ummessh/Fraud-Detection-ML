# 🛡️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **detecting fraudulent financial transactions** using Machine Learning.  
It involves data cleaning, feature selection, model building, and performance evaluation to help financial institutions proactively identify fraud.

## 📌 Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to fraudulent transactions.  
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that:  
- Identifies fraudulent customers/transactions  
- Provides insights into key fraud indicators  
- Suggests preventive measures for companies

## 🚀 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, outliers, multicollinearity  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand dataset & fraud trends  
3. **Feature Selection** – Identify key predictors of fraud  
4. **Modeling** – Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
6. **Insights & Action Plan** – Fraud prevention strategies  

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Identified key fraud predictors (e.g., unusual transaction patterns, high-risk features)  
- Built ML model capable of detecting fraudulent customers with high accuracy  
- Proposed infrastructure-level preventive measures  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Deploy as a **web app (Streamlit/Flask)** for real-time fraud detection  
- Experiment with **Deep Learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders)**  
- Use **Big Data platforms (Spark)** for large-scale processing
